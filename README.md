# Azure Cloud Resume Challenge

A full-stack serverless web application showcasing cloud engineering skills through a personal resume website built entirely on Microsoft Azure.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates proficiency in cloud technologies by implementing:

- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript hosted on Azure Storage with Azure CDN
- **Backend**: Azure Functions (Python) for API endpoints
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB for visitor counter
- **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- **Security**: HTTPS enforcement and custom domain configuration
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights for performance tracking

## üöÄ Features

- Responsive resume website with modern design
- Dynamic visitor counter using REST API
- Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- Cost-optimized serverless architecture
- Production-ready security configurations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **Frontend**: Hugo (static website - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Azure Functions, Python
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps
